# Belote — Initial Product Backlog

## Product goal

Deliver an approachable and reliable application for four-player French Belote,
allowing players to learn, play against AI, and play with friends online.

## Release scope

### MVP

The first playable release supports classic Belote, a full four-player table,
AI opponents, private online games, scoring, and a rules reference. The first
implementation target is a game to 1,000 points.

### Later releases

Coinchee/Contree, public matchmaking, player progression, local pass-and-play,
and social features follow after the core game is stable.

## Post-MVP backlog

- **US-016:** As an experienced player, I want to select Coinchee/Contree, so
  that I can play my preferred variant.
- **US-017:** As a player, I want public matchmaking, so that I can find a game
  without arranging one privately.

  Acceptance criteria:

  - The home screen offers a "Find a game" mode leading to `/online/public`.
  - Finding a game seats the player at the open public table of the chosen
    variant with the most seated players, or opens a new one when none exists.
  - Players are only matched with players who chose the same variant.
  - The game starts automatically when the fourth player is seated; no ready
    step or owner action is needed.
  - While waiting, the player sees the seated players and a countdown until
    bots take the empty seats (60 seconds after the table opened); when it
    reaches zero, bots fill the table and the game starts.
  - A waiting player can leave the table; their seat is freed for others.
  - Public tables show no invitation code and cannot be joined by code.
  - New texts are translated into French and Dutch.

  Design: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-02-public-matchmaking-design.md`.
- **US-018:** As a player, I want match history and statistics, so that I can
  follow my progress.

  Split into US-057 (sign in with an OAuth provider), US-058 (record finished
  matches) and US-059 (see my match history and statistics), under
  **Accounts and history** below. Design:
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-06-accounts-and-match-history-design.md`.
- **US-019:** As players sharing one device, we want pass-and-play, so that we
  can play locally.

  Acceptance criteria:

  - The home screen offers a "Pass and play" mode leading to `/play/local`.
  - Two to four players enter their names in the seats they choose (North,
    East, South, West); bots take the empty seats. The players choose the
    variant and the bots' difficulty. Names are required, at most 30
    characters, and differ from each other.
  - The game runs on the server, like a game against bots: bots play their
    turns, and the device always shows the hand of the human whose turn it is.
  - Before a different human's turn, a full-screen hand-off screen hides every
    card and asks to pass the device to that player, who taps "I'm ready" to
    see their hand. A completed trick stays with the player who just played.
  - Pass-and-play matches are not recorded in the match history, since one
    device and one sign-in cannot tell the players apart.
  - New texts are translated into French and Dutch.
- **US-020:** As a player, I want optional in-table reactions or chat, so that
  online games feel social.

  Acceptance criteria:

  - At private and public tables, while a match is played, a seated player can
    send one of six preset reactions: "Well played!", "Nice hand!", "Oops!",
    "Wow!", "Let me think…" and "Good game!". There is no free text, so
    nothing needs moderating or storing.
  - The other players see the reaction for a few seconds next to the sender's
    seat, in their own language.
  - The server accepts at most three reactions per player in ten seconds.
  - A setting turns reactions off: the player neither sees nor sends them.
  - Reactions are not offered in solo or pass-and-play games.
  - New texts are translated into French and Dutch.

## Additional user stories delivered after US-016

These stories were implemented after Coinchee/Contree (US-016) without being

  scrolling.
- The header and HUD are compact, the table is flexible, cards are smaller,
  and the contract picker fits on one row.

### E05 — Reliable online play

**US-030 — Keep the service available under abuse**

As an operator, I want the server to bound its resource use, so that a single
client cannot degrade or exhaust the service.

Acceptance criteria:

- API requests are rate limited per client, with a stricter limit on game and
  table creation or joining; excess requests receive `429` with
  `Retry-After`.
- API request bodies above a size limit receive `413`.

## Improvement user stories

These stories come from the improvement list gathered while playing the
application. They are not implemented yet.

### Terminology

**US-032 — Call computer players “bots” everywhere**

As a player, I want computer-controlled players to be consistently called
“bots”, so that the vocabulary is the same throughout the application.

Acceptance criteria:

- All UI text, in every language, uses “bot” instead of “AI”.
- Classes, endpoints, and other code identifiers are renamed from “AI” to
  “bot”.

### Bot play

**US-033 — Bots do not waste an ace on an opponent's trump**

As a player, I want bots to avoid playing an ace on a trick already trumped by
the opposing team, so that my bot partner does not give away points.

Acceptance criteria:

- When an opponent has trumped the current trick and the bot cannot win it,
  the bot does not play an ace if another legal card is available.

**US-034 — Bots do not trump the first trick when defending**

As a player, I want bots outside the contract-winning team not to play trump
on the first trick, so that they keep their trumps to defend.

Acceptance criteria:

- On the first trick, a bot whose team did not win the bidding does not play
  trump unless it has no other legal card.

**US-035 — Bots support their partner's bid**

As a player, I want bots to follow common bidding conventions with their
partner, so that the team reaches sensible contracts.

Acceptance criteria:

- A bot raises its partner's bid by 20 in the same suit when it holds:
  - the jack of the bid suit; or
  - two aces in other suits and a few cards of the bid suit.
- A bot raises its partner's bid by 10 in the same suit when it holds:
  - one ace in another suit and the nine of the bid suit; or
  - two aces in other suits and no card of the bid suit.

**US-036 — Bots do not throw valuable cards on lost tricks**

As a player, I want bots to avoid playing high-value cards on a trick that
the other team will obviously win, so that points are not given away.

Acceptance criteria:

- When the trick is clearly won by the opposing team, a bot plays its
  lowest-value legal card.

**US-037 — Bots cash their aces in time**

As a player, I want bots not to hold on to their aces too long, so that the
aces are not trumped the next time their suit is played.

Acceptance criteria:

- A bot considers the risk of an ace being trumped when that suit is next
  played, and plays the ace earlier when the risk is high.

**US-038 — Plan better bot play**

As a player, I want a plan to make bots stronger, so that games against bots
are more challenging and bot partners more reliable.

Acceptance criteria:

- A written plan identifies the main weaknesses of the current bot, possible
  algorithms, and a way to measure the bot's win rate.
- The plan is split into implementable user stories.

The plan is in `docs/bot-play-plan.md`. The stories below implement it.

**US-047 — Measure bot strength in a bot arena**

As a developer, I want to play bots against each other on repeatable deals, so
that every bot improvement is proven by a measured win rate.

Acceptance criteria:

- Deals can be generated from a seed, and the same seed gives the same deals.
- A headless arena plays two bot strategies against each other, in classic
  Belote and in Contrée. It uses the duplicate format: every deal is played
  twice, with the teams swapping seats.
- The arena reports:
  - the average point difference per deal, with a 95% confidence interval;
  - the win rate in matches to 1,000 points;
  - the contract success rate and the coinche success rate;
  - the redeal rate;
  - the decision time per card.
- The arena runs through a dedicated Gradle task and is not part of
  `./gradlew test`. A short arena run stays in the normal test suite.
- A random legal-card bot is available as a baseline.

**US-048 — Separate bot decisions from the rules engine**

As a developer, I want bot strategies to see only what their player can see,
so that bots cannot cheat and strategies can be swapped.

Acceptance criteria:

- Bidding and card-play decisions go through a bot strategy interface. A
  strategy receives only its player's view:
  - its own hand and legal cards;
  - the auction;
  - the contract;
  - the tricks played so far, with who played each card.
- `GameBoard` and `BotPlayers` no longer contain strategy rules.
- The existing bot behaviour (US-033 to US-037) is unchanged: for the same
  seed, the arena gives the same results before and after the change.

**US-049 — Make the difficulty levels play differently**

As a solo player, I want the difficulty I choose to change how well the bots
play, so that the challenge matches my experience.

Acceptance criteria:

- Each difficulty level uses its own bot strategy. Until the Challenging
  strategy exists (US-056), both levels use the current strategy.
- Bots at private tables use the Challenging strategy.

**US-050 — Bots take contracts in classic Belote**

As a player, I want bots to take a contract when their hand is strong enough,
so that I am not forced to take every contract and deals are not redealt
needlessly.

Acceptance criteria:

- A bot scores its hand for a trump suit using:
  - the jack and nine of that suit;
  - the number of trumps;
  - its aces in other suits;
  - the belote (king and queen of trumps).
- In the first round, a bot accepts the upturned suit when its score reaches a
  threshold. In the second round, it chooses its best suit other than the
  upturned one when that suit's score reaches the threshold.
- In the arena, the new bidding beats the current bidding in point difference.
  The redeal rate and contract success rate are reported.

**US-051 — Bots bid in Contrée according to their hand**

As a player, I want bots to bid what their hand is worth in Contrée, so that
their contracts are realistic and they compete with the opponents.

Acceptance criteria:

- A bot estimates the points its hand can make in each trump suit. It opens
  only when the estimate reaches 80, at the level of the estimate.
- A bot overcalls an opponent's contract when its estimate is higher than the
  current contract.
- Partner support (US-035) still applies.
- In the arena, the new bidding beats the current bidding in point difference
  in Contrée.

**US-052 — Solve a round with all cards visible**

As a developer, I want a solver that finds the best play when all hands are
known, so that stronger bots can search ahead.

Acceptance criteria:

- Given four known hands, the trump suit, and the tricks already played, the
  solver returns the best result each team can force and the card that
  achieves it. The result includes the last-trick bonus (dix de der) and the
  belote.
- Tests on hand-built endgames show the solver's results are exact.
- A benchmark gives the time to solve a full round and a round from the
  fourth trick, on the JVM and in the native image.

**US-053 — Bots play to win and score tricks**

As a player, I want bots to win tricks cheaply and give points to their
partner, so that they play like sensible card players.

Acceptance criteria:

- Bots remember the cards played. They know which cards are masters, how many
  trumps remain, and which suits each player has shown to be void in.
- When the trick is not yet won by its partner, a bot wins it with its
  cheapest winning card, where that is possible and worth it.
- When its partner is sure to win the trick, a bot adds its highest-value
  card that it does not need later.
- When leading, a bot prefers its master cards. It avoids leading a suit in
  which it holds the ten without the ace.
- In the arena, the new card play beats the current card play in point
  difference.

**US-054 — Declaring bots manage their trumps**

As a player, I want a bot that holds the contract to take control with its
trumps, so that it makes its contract more often.

Acceptance criteria:

- A bot on the declaring team leads trumps while the opponents may still hold
  trumps and its team holds the master trump.
- A bot keeps its jack and nine of trumps to regain the lead, rather than
  using them on low-value tricks.
- In the arena, the contract success rate rises compared with the previous
  strategy, and the point difference is positive.

**US-055 — Bots coinche contracts they expect to defeat**

As a player, I want bots to coinche when they are confident of defeating the
contract, so that overbidding is punished.

Acceptance criteria:

- A defending bot coinches when its estimated defensive points make the
  contract very likely to fail.
- In the arena, coinches by bots succeed at least two times out of three, and
  coinching improves the point difference.

**US-056 — Challenging bots search before playing a card**

As an experienced player, I want Challenging bots to look ahead before
choosing a card, so that the game is a real challenge.

Acceptance criteria:

- To choose a card, a Challenging bot:
  1. samples many deals of the unseen cards, consistent with its own hand,
     the cards played, and the voids shown;
  2. solves each sample with the solver (US-052);
  3. plays the card with the best average result.
- A bot uses only information its player can see.
- A bot chooses a card within a configurable time budget, 200 ms by default,
  on the JVM and in the native image.
- With a fixed seed, a bot's decisions are repeatable.
- In the arena, the Challenging strategy beats the Relaxed strategy in point
  difference in both variants. The lower bound of the 95% confidence interval
  is above zero.

### Table presentation

**US-039 — Fit the table on a laptop screen**

As a player on a laptop, I want the table and the UI to fit my screen, so that
I can play without scrolling or zooming out.

Acceptance criteria:

- On typical laptop screen sizes, the whole table, the player's hand, and the
  game controls are visible without scrolling.

**US-040 — Animate bidding at private tables**

As a player at a private table, I want the same bidding animations as in bot
games, so that I can follow each player's decision.

Acceptance criteria:

- The bidding animations of US-021 are also shown at private tables.

**US-041 — Collect tricks automatically**

As a player, I want completed tricks to be collected automatically after a
short delay, so that I can see the cards without having to press a button.

Acceptance criteria:

- The “pick up the trick” button is removed.
- A completed trick stays visible long enough for players to see the cards,
  then is collected with an animation.

**US-042 — Play the last trick automatically**

As a player, I want the last trick to be played automatically, so that I do
not have to play a card that is my only choice.

Acceptance criteria:

- When each player has one card left, the application plays them
  automatically, one after the other, without waiting for the players.

### Private tables

**US-043 — Choose seats when starting with bots**

As a private table owner who starts a game without all players, I want the
players to choose their positions at the table, so that we can pick our
partners.

Acceptance criteria:

- Before a game starts with bots, the human players can choose their seats.
- Bots take the remaining seats.

### Scoring

**US-044 — Score a capot**

As a player, I want a team that takes every trick to receive the capot score,
so that the scoring follows the rules.

Acceptance criteria:

- A team that takes all the tricks of a round scores 250 instead of 162.
- In Coinchee/Contree, the team also scores its bid.
- Belote/Rebelote adds 20 points to the declaring team.

**US-045 — Accumulate scores across rounds**

As a player, I want team scores to accumulate between rounds in bot games and
at private tables, so that we play a full match.

Acceptance criteria:

- Team scores are added up round after round, both in bot games and at
  private tables.

**US-046 — Win the match at 1,000 points**

As a player, I want the first team to reach 1,000 points to win the match, so
that the match has a clear end.

Acceptance criteria:

- The match ends when a team reaches 1,000 points, both in bot games and at
  private tables, and the winning team is announced.

### Accounts and history

**US-057 — Sign in with an OAuth provider**

As a player, I want to sign in with an existing Google or GitHub account, so
that the game can remember my matches without a new password.

Acceptance criteria:

- The home screen offers "Sign in with Google" and "Sign in with GitHub" for
  each configured provider, and nothing when none is configured.
- The first sign-in creates an account named after the provider's profile
  (name, else login). Later sign-ins with the same provider account find it.
- When signed in, the home screen shows the player's name and a "Sign out"
  button, and the name is suggested when creating or joining a table.
- Guests can still play every mode without signing in.
- Accounts are stored in MariaDB (PostgreSQL until ADR-002), created by a
  Flyway migration.
- Provider credentials and the database come from environment variables,
  documented in the README with the Docker Compose setup.

**US-058 — Record finished matches**

As a signed-in player, I want my finished matches recorded, so that I can look
back at them. Criteria in the design document.

**US-059 — See my match history and statistics**

As a signed-in player, I want to see my results, so that I can follow my
progress. Criteria in the design document.

## Roadmap after US-059

Every story up to US-059 is delivered. The stories below are grouped into
four phases, in the recommended order. Each phase can ship on its own.

| Phase | Goal | Stories |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 — Complete the rules | Play Belote as it is played at a real table | US-060 to US-064 |
| 2 — Learn by playing | Help players improve, reusing the solver | US-065 to US-067 |
| 3 — Compete and connect | Give signed-in players reasons to come back | US-068 to US-072 |
| 4 — Reach more players | Install the game and play it without a mouse | US-073 to US-074 |
| 5 — Email accounts and privacy | Sign up without a Google or GitHub account, and control my data | US-075 to US-083 |

Why this order:

- **Rules before features.** Players who know the game will miss the
  announcements (tierce, cinquante, cent, carré). They change the scoring, so
  they must come before ratings (US-068); otherwise ratings would be based on
  incomplete rules.
- **Coaching reuses the solver.** The double-dummy solver (US-052) and the
  sampling strategy (US-056) already compute the best play. A hint and a
  round review mostly need UI.
- **Competition needs players.** Ratings, leaderboards, and friends only make
  sense once public matchmaking has steady traffic.
- **Privacy before publishing names.** Phase 5 does not depend on the other
  phases. The privacy stories (US-081 to US-083) should ship before the
  leaderboard (US-069) shows players' names to everyone.

### Phase 1 — Complete the rules

**US-060 — Declare announcements**

As a player, I want to declare tierce, cinquante, cent, and carrés, so that
the game follows the full Belote rules.

Acceptance criteria:

- During the first trick, a player can declare sequences (tierce: 20,
  cinquante: 50, cent: 100) and carrés (jacks: 200, nines: 150, aces, tens,
  kings, queens: 100).
- Only the team with the best announcement scores its announcements. The
  best is the highest value, then the longest sequence, then the highest
  card, then the trump sequence; the first declarer wins remaining ties.
- Announcements are shown to every player at the end of the first trick, and
  counted in the contract outcome and in the round breakdown (US-009).
- A table option turns announcements on or off before the game starts. They
  are on by default.
- The rules reference (US-011) explains them.
- New texts are translated into French and Dutch.

Functional tasks:

- Confirm the rule source for announcement values, ties, and whether
  announcements count towards making the contract.

**US-061 — Bots declare and use announcements**

As a player, I want bots to declare their announcements and take them into
account, so that they play by the same rules as me.

Acceptance criteria:

- Bots always declare their announcements; bidding estimates include them.
- Bots use the cards revealed by the opponents' announcements, in card
  memory and in the Challenging bot's samples (US-056).
- The solver (US-052) scores announcements.
- In the arena, bidding with announcements beats bidding without them in
  point difference.

**US-062 — Choose the match target**

As a table owner or solo player, I want to choose how many points win the
match, so that a match fits the time we have.

Acceptance criteria:

- Before the game, the player chooses 500, 1,000 (default), 1,500, or 2,000
  points, using a button group (US-028).
- The target is shown during the game and used to end the match (US-046).
- Public matchmaking (US-017) stays at 1,000 points.
- The match history records the target of each match.
- New texts are translated into French and Dutch.

**US-063 — Play all trumps and no trumps in Contrée**

As an experienced player, I want to bid all trumps (tout-atout) and no trumps
(sans-atout) in Contrée, so that I can play my strongest hands.

Acceptance criteria:

- In Contrée, a player can bid tout-atout or sans-atout in addition to the
  four suits. Each ranks above the suits at the same level.
- Tout-atout: every suit uses the trump order and values. Sans-atout: every
  suit uses the plain order and values.
- Legal-move rules, trick resolution, belote, capot, and scoring are adapted
  to both contracts, and each has rule-engine tests.
- The rules reference and the tutorial glossary explain them.
- New texts are translated into French and Dutch.

Functional tasks:

- Confirm the point scales of tout-atout and sans-atout used by the rule
  source.

**US-064 — Bots bid and play all trumps and no trumps**

As a player, I want bots to bid and play tout-atout and sans-atout, so that
they use the whole Contrée auction.

Acceptance criteria:

- Bots estimate tout-atout and sans-atout hands and bid them when the
  estimate is the best.
- The solver and the Challenging bot handle both contracts.
- In the arena, Contrée bots with the new contracts beat bots without them in
  point difference.

### Phase 2 — Learn by playing

**US-065 — Ask for a hint**

As a learning player, I want to ask which card or bid is best, so that I can
improve while I play.

Acceptance criteria:

- In solo games, a "Hint" button highlights the card or bid that the
  Challenging bot would choose, using only the player's view.
- The hint gives a short reason ("Win the trick cheaply", "Give points to
  your partner", "Lead trumps").
- Hints are not offered in online games.
- New texts are translated into French and Dutch.

**US-066 — Review a finished round**

As a player, I want to replay the tricks of the last round, so that I can
understand what happened.

Acceptance criteria:

- From the round result, the player can step through the tricks one by one,
  seeing who played each card and who won the trick.
- In solo games, all four hands are shown during the review. In online
  games, only the cards that were played are shown.
- New texts are translated into French and Dutch.

**US-067 — See my costly mistakes**

As a learning player, I want the review to point out the cards that cost my
team points, so that I learn from my mistakes.

Acceptance criteria:

- In a solo-game review, the solver compares each of my cards with the best
  card for the same situation.
- Cards that lost my team ten or more points are marked, with the better
  card and the number of points lost.
- The analysis runs on the server within a time budget, without blocking
  the next round.
- New texts are translated into French and Dutch.

### Phase 3 — Compete and connect

**US-068 — Earn a rating in public games**

As a competitive signed-in player, I want a rating that changes with my
public-game results, so that I can measure my level.

Acceptance criteria:

- Signed-in players have a rating per variant. It changes after each
  finished public match (US-017) based on the result and on the ratings of
  both teams.
- Matches with bots, private tables, and abandoned matches do not change the
  rating.
- The rating is shown on the statistics page (US-059) with its history.
- New texts are translated into French and Dutch.

**US-069 — See the leaderboard**

As a competitive player, I want a leaderboard of the best-rated players, so
that I can compare myself with others.

Acceptance criteria:

- A leaderboard page lists the top 50 players per variant with their rating
  and number of matches. Players need at least ten rated matches to appear.
- A signed-in player sees their own rank even when it is outside the top 50.
- A player can hide themselves from the leaderboard in Settings.
- New texts are translated into French and Dutch.

**US-070 — Invite my friends**

As a signed-in player, I want to keep a list of friends and invite them to my
table, so that I don't have to send a code every time.

Acceptance criteria:

- A player can add a friend by sharing a personal friend link; both players
  must accept.
- A table owner can invite online friends from the lobby; the friend gets
  a notification in the app and can join in one click.
- A player can remove a friend at any time.
- New texts are translated into French and Dutch.

**US-071 — Watch a game**

As a player, I want to watch a game at a friend's table, so that I can learn
or wait for a seat.

Acceptance criteria:

- A table owner can allow spectators before the game starts.
- Spectators see the played cards, the bids, and the scores, but never a
  player's hand.
- Spectators cannot send reactions; seated players see how many spectators
  are watching.
- New texts are translated into French and Dutch.

**US-072 — Choose my display name**

As a signed-in player, I want to change the name shown to other players, so
that I am not forced to use my provider's profile name.

Acceptance criteria:

- A signed-in player can change their display name in Settings; it follows
  the existing name rules (at most 30 characters).
- The new name is used at tables, in match history, and on the leaderboard.
- New texts are translated into French and Dutch.

### Phase 4 — Reach more players

**US-073 — Install the game on my phone**

As a mobile player, I want to install Beelot from the browser, so that I can
start it like an app.

Acceptance criteria:

- The application is an installable Progressive Web App, with a manifest and
  icons.
- After the first visit, the shell, the rules reference, and the tutorial
  load without a network connection; online modes explain that a connection
  is needed.
- New texts are translated into French and Dutch.

**US-074 — Play with the keyboard and a screen reader**

As a player who doesn't use a mouse, I want to play every action with the
keyboard and hear the game through a screen reader, so that the game is
accessible to me.

Acceptance criteria:

- Cards, bids, and every game control can be reached and used with the
  keyboard, with a visible focus.
- Game events (bids, cards played, trick winner, round result) are announced
  through a live region.
- An accessibility audit of the main screens reports no serious issue.
- New texts are translated into French and Dutch.

### Phase 5 — Email accounts and privacy

Players without a Google or GitHub account can create an account with an email
address and a password. The stories follow the GDPR (RGPD), and they apply the
authentication controls of PCI DSS v4.0 requirement 8 as a security baseline.
Beelot processes no payment cards, so PCI DSS does not formally apply; see the
decisions below.

Accounts are managed by Zitadel (ADR-003). Zitadel hosts the pages for
registration, sign-in, email confirmation, password reset and second factors,
stores the passwords, and sends the account emails. Spring signs players in
with OpenID Connect, as it does for Google and GitHub since US-057, and never
sees a password. Google and GitHub move behind Zitadel.

Shared rules for every story in this phase:

- Every page and API is served over HTTPS only, with HSTS. The session cookie
  is `Secure`, `HttpOnly` and `SameSite=Lax`.
- Passwords, tokens and session ids never appear in logs, error messages,
  URLs sent to third parties, or analytics.
- Zitadel's hosted pages use Beelot's branding and are shown in the player's
  language (English, French or Dutch), like its emails.
- Zitadel sends emails through an SMTP server configured in Zitadel.
- The Zitadel settings (password rules, lock, link expiries, factors) are
  recorded in the repository and applied by a script, so that they can be
  reviewed and reproduced.
- The Zitadel issuer URL, client id and secret, and the API token of the
  scheduled jobs come from environment variables, documented in the README.
- New texts are translated into French and Dutch.

**US-075 — Create an account with an email and a password**

As a player without a Google or GitHub account, I want to create an account
with my email address and a password, so that my matches are recorded.

Acceptance criteria:

- The home screen offers "Create an account" next to the sign-in buttons. It
  opens Zitadel's registration page, which asks for an email address, a
  display name (the existing name rules, at most 30 characters) and a
  password.
- Zitadel requires passwords of at least 12 characters (PCI DSS 8.3.6) and
  stores them only as salted hashes (PCI DSS 8.3.2). There is no check
  against breached passwords, because Zitadel has none (ADR-003).
- The registration page links to the privacy policy (US-083) and states what
  is stored and why (GDPR article 13). Account creation is based on the
  performance of a contract, so no pre-ticked box and no marketing consent
  are involved.
- Registering with an address that already has an account does not reveal
  that the account exists (to verify in Zitadel, ADR-003).
- The new account cannot sign in until its email address is confirmed
  (US-076).
- On the first sign-in, Spring creates the player's row in the `account`
  table. It refers to the Zitadel user id and stores no email address and no
  password (data minimisation).

**US-076 — Confirm my email address**

As a new player, I want to confirm my email address, so that the game knows
the address is mine and can reach me to reset my password.

Acceptance criteria:

- After registration, Zitadel sends an email with a confirmation link or
  code. It works once and expires after 24 hours.
- An expired link can be replaced by a new one from Zitadel's pages.
- Signing in to an unconfirmed account asks the player to confirm the address
  first.
- A scheduled job in Spring deletes, through Zitadel's API, accounts left
  unconfirmed for 7 days.

**US-077 — Sign in with my email and password**

As a player with an email account, I want to sign in with my email address
and password, so that I get my history on any device.

Acceptance criteria:

- The home screen offers "Sign in", which opens Zitadel's sign-in page with
  the email form and the Google and GitHub buttons.
- Existing Google and GitHub accounts keep their history: a migration links
  each `account` row to its Zitadel user by provider and subject.
- Zitadel does not reveal which addresses have an account ("ignore unknown
  usernames").
- After 10 failed attempts in a row, Zitadel locks the account (PCI DSS
  8.3.4). A scheduled job in Spring unlocks it 30 minutes later, because
  Zitadel can only be unlocked by an administrator.
- A successful sign-in creates a new Spring session id (no session fixation).
- A session ends after 15 minutes without any request (PCI DSS 8.2.8); an
  ongoing game counts as activity. A session lasts at most 30 days.
- Signing out ends the Spring session and the Zitadel session.
- The page shows when the last sign-in happened, so the player can spot
  unexpected access.

**US-078 — Reset a forgotten password**

As a player who forgot their password, I want to choose a new one through my
email address, so that I can get my account back.

Acceptance criteria:

- Zitadel's sign-in page offers "Forgot your password?", which sends a reset
  link without revealing whether the address has an account.
- The link works once and expires after 1 hour.
- The new password follows the rules of US-075. Reuse of earlier passwords is
  not checked: Zitadel has no password history, and NIST SP 800-63B does not
  require it (ADR-003).
- After the reset, Zitadel emails the player that the password changed, and
  the player's other sessions end (to verify: Zitadel's back-channel logout,
  or a session check in Spring).

**US-079 — Change my password or email address**

As a signed-in player, I want to change my password or my email address, so
that I can keep my account secure and reachable.

Acceptance criteria:

- An "Account" section in Settings links email-account players to Zitadel's
  account page, where they can change their password or email address.
- Changing the password requires the current one and sends a confirmation
  email.
- A new email address is used only after it is confirmed, with the rules of
  US-076. The old address is notified (to verify in Zitadel).
- Google and GitHub accounts do not see these options.

**US-080 — Protect my account with a second factor**

As a player who cares about security, I want to turn on a second factor, so
that a stolen password is not enough to take over my account.

Acceptance criteria:

- From Zitadel's account page, an email-account player can add an
  authenticator app (TOTP), a passkey, or a code sent by email.
- Once a second factor is on, signing in asks for it after the password.
  Wrong codes count towards the lock of US-077.
- Instead of recovery codes, the player is encouraged to add a second factor
  as a backup (for example a passkey and an authenticator app). Recovery codes
  are added once Zitadel supports them reliably (ADR-003).
- A second factor is optional for players (PCI DSS requires it only for access
  to cardholder data).

**US-081 — Delete my account**

As a signed-in player, I want to delete my account, so that the game no longer
keeps my personal data (GDPR article 17).

Acceptance criteria:

- Settings offers "Delete my account". It asks the player to sign in again and
  to confirm.
- Spring deletes the Zitadel user through the API, then the player's
  `account` row and sessions.
- Zitadel no longer keeps the player's personal data after deletion,
  including in its event history (to verify, ADR-003).
- Finished matches stay in other players' history, but the deleted player's
  seats show "Deleted player" and no longer link to an account.
- Backups containing the account are overwritten within the backup retention
  period stated in the privacy policy.

**US-082 — Download my data**

As a signed-in player, I want to download the data the game keeps about me, so
that I can see it and take it elsewhere (GDPR articles 15 and 20).

Acceptance criteria:

- Settings offers "Download my data". It returns a JSON file with the account
  details from Zitadel (email, display name, creation date, second factors
  without their secrets), the sign-in history and every recorded match of the
  player.
- The export is available only to the signed-in owner. It is limited to one
  per hour.

**US-083 — Know how my data is handled**

As a player, I want to read how my personal data is used and kept, so that I
can trust the game with it.

Acceptance criteria:

- A privacy policy page, linked from the home screen and the registration
  page, states:
  - the data controller and a contact address;
  - the data stored, the purposes and the legal bases;
  - the processors: hosting, Zitadel and its subprocessors, and the SMTP
    provider;
  - the retention periods, the player's rights, and the right to complain to
    the CNIL.
- A data processing agreement is signed with Zitadel and with the SMTP
  provider (GDPR article 28).
- Retention periods are enforced by a scheduled job in Spring, through
  Zitadel's API when needed:
  - unconfirmed accounts after 7 days (US-076);
  - accounts without a sign-in for 3 years, after a warning email 30 days
    before deletion;
  - Spring's security events after 12 months.
- Spring records security events without tokens (PCI DSS 10.2): sign-in,
  sign-out, session expiry, unlock, export and deletion. Each event stores the
  account, the time, the IP address and the outcome. Zitadel records the
  events of its own pages (registration, failed sign-ins, lock, password and
  factor changes).
- Beelot sets only the session cookie and the CSRF cookie, and Zitadel only
  the cookies of its sign-in session. They are strictly necessary, so no
  cookie banner is needed; the policy lists them.
- The data breach procedure (who decides, notifying the CNIL within 72 hours,
  informing players) is documented in `docs/`.

### Decisions required for the roadmap

- Select the rule source for announcements (US-060) and the tout-atout and
  sans-atout scales (US-063).
- Choose the rating system for US-068 (Elo by team average, or Glicko-2).
- Confirm the scope of PCI DSS for phase 5. Beelot stores no cardholder data,
  so PCI DSS does not formally apply; the stories adopt its requirement 8
  controls as a baseline. They leave out the 90-day password change
  (8.3.9/8.3.10.1), which applies only to accounts with access to cardholder
  data and which NIST SP 800-63B advises against. If payments are ever added,
  they must go through a hosted payment provider so that card data never
  reaches Beelot.
- Accept ADR-003 (Zitadel Cloud as the identity provider) once its four
  checks are done: no inactivity clause and the behaviour above 100 daily
  active users, erasure from the event history, French and Dutch pages, and
  no account disclosure at registration.
- Choose the SMTP provider for production.
- Name the data controller and the privacy contact for the privacy policy.

## Decisions required before implementation

- Confirm the initial platform: web, mobile, or both.
- Confirm whether online play is in scope for the first release or follows the
  AI-only playable version.
- Select the authoritative classic-Belote rules source and regional options.
- ~~Decide whether guests may play online and what account model is required.~~
  Guests play every mode; accounts sign in with OAuth (US-057), or with an
  email and a password through Zitadel once phase 5 ships (US-075, ADR-003).
- Define the privacy, moderation, and age requirements before adding chat or
  public matchmaking. (US-020 offers preset reactions only, with no free text,
  so it needs none of them.)
